# Project Proposal
## Project Title : ArtistsGo
## What and Why
This project will gather the artists we have in NYU for people to aquire their products or services and inspire collaboration between student artists.
There are many many NYU students who have incredible talents. I have met people who can do nail art better than nail salons, make candles, paint pet portraits for their friends, and much more.
I believe it will be an amazing idea to showcase these talents on a artists collective website. For example, fellow students can go to another student to do their nails. 
Or if a student is making beautiful pottery vase as a hobby and another student happens to be wanting to purchase a vase, this website would be perfect to connect these students together.
I would also imagine it will encourage interactions between artists. Painters can go paint together and musician play music together.

## For whom
The website will be for fellow NYU students just like myself. Best case scenario we can create an online community for the student artists and hopefully cheaper and better artful products compare to general nyc prices.

## How
The website should have functions for users to post their works. There should be functions for users to create their profiles and have categorized subpages to post.
So after artists create their profile. If they are dancers, they can decide to post a video in the subpage that is labeled as Dance.
If they are painters, they can post under painting. And in these posts, there should be availibility for Captions from creators and comments from fellow community members. 
If possible there can be a "want to work together" function to connect people to work together. And if the artists are looking to sell, then they can post in "Market."
In the market subpage, there should be price listing and options to buy and buyers being able to send a message to sellers.
Transactions should be discussed between buyers and sellers. The website doesn't deal with money. 
The main page can have community highlight from each subpage. 

## Scope 
The website will have functions for people to post, chat, and connect. We can think about adding more functionality throughout the semester but this shouldn't be an incredibly complicated system.
There will still be quite a functions we need to deal with for example to have people being able to login and build a profile will be some work.
But overall this is an exciting project for me if built nicely!
